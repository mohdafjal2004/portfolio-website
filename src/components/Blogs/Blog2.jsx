      <h3>React Performance Optimization Techniques</h3>
      React is known for its fast user interface, but as an application grows,
      developers may encounter performance issues. In this blog, we will discuss
      some important ways to optimize the performance of a React application.
      <br />
      <span>
        <b>Use Functional Components </b>
      </span>
      Explain how functional components are more performant compared to class
      components. Discuss the benefits of functional components, such as better
      rendering performance and improved memory usage.
      <br />
      <span>
        <b>Memoization with React Memo and useCallback:</b>
      </span>
      Introduce the concept of memoization to optimize component re-renders.
      Explain how to use React memo higher-order component and useCallback
      hook to memoize components and functions, respectively.
      <br />
      <span>
        <b>Virtualization with React Virtualized:</b>
      </span>
      Discuss the use of virtualization to handle large lists and tables
      efficiently. Explain how React Virtualized library helps in rendering only
      the visible portion of the list, thereby improving performance.
      <br />
      <span>
        <b>Code Splitting and Lazy Loading:</b>
      </span>
      Describe the technique of code splitting to divide the application into
      smaller chunks. Discuss how lazy loading can be used to load components or
      routes on-demand, reducing the initial loading time of the application.
      <br />
      <span>
        <b>React Profiler and Performance Monitoring:</b>
      </span>
      Introduce the React Profiler tool to identify performance bottlenecks in
      components. Discuss the importance of performance monitoring tools like
      Lighthouse and React Developer Tools for analyzing and optimizing app
      performance.
      <br />
      <span>
        <b>Using Production Build and Minification:</b>
      </span>
      Explain the benefits of using production builds for React applications.
      Discuss how minification and compression techniques can significantly
      reduce the size of JavaScript bundles for better performance.
